    "description": "This library links in the version of FreeRTOS shipped with the STM32Cube framework.\n\nConfiguration is possible with extra options in the platformio.ini.\nThese are:\n\n    - custom_freertos_config_location: *REQUIRED* must point to either a path containing FreeRTOSConfig.h or the file itself.\n    - custom_freertos_heap_impl: *OPTIONAL, defaults to heap_4.c* heap implementation file to use (see FreeRTOS docs)\n    - custom_freertos_features: *OPTIONAL*, comma separated list of optional files to build, any of [\"coroutines\", \"timers\", \"event_groups\", \"stream_buffers\"]\n\nThere is currently no support for the MPU.\nIf you use the RTOS heap you may want to disable allocation of a heap in the link script.\nA good starting point for the FreeRTOSConfig.h is in the include directory, and can be used a default by using\n\n```\n#include \"FreeRTOSConfig_template.h\"\n```\n\nas your FreeRTOSConfig.h, or by simply copying its contents which is the preferred method if you plan to modify values in it.\n",
